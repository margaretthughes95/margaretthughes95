- 👋 Hi, I’m @margaretthughes95
- 👀 I’m interested in movement ecology and behaviour in wildlife. My research and general interests fall in applied conservation. Currently working with woodland caribou in Western canada at the University of Calgary as a PhD candidate
- 🌱 I’m currently learning spatial mapping and analysis for habitat suitability and selection. Generally about animal movement and behaviour. I am currently struggling my way through learning Google Earth Engine to extract continuous landscape variables (i.e. NDVI and Snow Dpth) to use for applied conservation questions. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything animal movement based/science communication. I have no say in data sharing, and am unable to provide datasets related to my project due to data sharing agreements, but always willing to share extracted publicly available landscape variables!
